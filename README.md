# 🚼 DevPulse – Internal Tech Issue & Feature Tracker

DevPulse is a streamlined, enterprise-grade collaboration backend designed for software engineering units to seamlessly document application bugs, map system requirements, track feature development, and monitor resolution loops.

## Live Deployment Links
- **REST Engine Live URL:** [https://devpulse-api.vercel.app](https://devpulse-api.vercel.app)
- **Source Repository:** [https://github.com/yourusername/devpulse](https://github.com/yourusername/devpulse)

## Core Capabilities
- **Role Isolation Matrix:** Differentiated privileges for `contributors` (creation and basic ownership updates) and `maintainers` (global operations, deletions, system data metrics monitoring).
- **No-JOIN Structural Architecture:** Relational aggregation engineered purely within memory loops to minimize database joining overhead and optimize horizontal operational scaling.
- **Strict Cryptographic Security:** Hashed passwords leveraging native `bcrypt` dynamics, paired with state-aware JSON Web Token checks across private routing paths.
